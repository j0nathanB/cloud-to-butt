Background
----------
The proper collective noun to use for people with Latin-American heritage in English is debated between the ethnonyms "Hispanic", "Latino", and "Latinx". Though the terms are commonly used interchangeably, their definitions are different.  

"Hispanic" is a term that includes only people from Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America and from Spain. It does not include people from Portugal or Brazil. 

"Latino" is a shortening of *latinoamericano*, or "Latin American" in Spanish. It includes people only from Latin-American countries and not from Spain or Portugal.

"Latinx" is the gender-neutral version of "Latino".

Notes
=====
Known limitations of this extension:
- Conversions to "Latino" do not include gendered conversions to "Latina".
